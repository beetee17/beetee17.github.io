# Subtasks

Most tasks are not well-represented as a single step, with a binary state of completed and incomplete. Oftentimes, we are faced with tasks that are broad or complex, and become demotivated as we do not know where to start.

Subtasks allow you to overcome this issue and group closely related tasks together. They allow you to break down a task into smaller components.

Moreover, by breaking down a task into smaller steps, you can visualise your completion progress as a continuous value rather than single binary value!

Create or edit subtasks of a todo via the detail view that is presented when tapping on the plus-icon or any existing todo. You can  also make exisiting tasks be subtasks as shown below.

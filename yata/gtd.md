# Getting Things Done (GTD)

GTD is a popular task management system created by David Allen. The methodology is based on a simple truth: **our brains are for having ideas, not storing them**.

The more information bouncing around inside your head, the harder it is to decide what needs attention. As a result, **you spend more time thinking about your tasks than actually doing them**. When information piles up in your head, it can lead to stress, anxiety, or a loss in focus.

The GTD method describes **how to dump all your mental clutter into an external system and then organize it so you can focus on the right things at the right times**.

When your GTD workflow is set up right, you’ll be able to confidently answer “*what should I be working on?*” at any given moment without worrying that you might forget something important you need to do later.

Yata makes it easy to incorporate a similar workflow, with the **Inbox**, **Scheduled**, **Anytime** and **Someday** lists.

In Yata, a task is shown in the **Inbox** when it does not have an assigned [intent date](https://beetee17.github.io/yata/intent). It is recommended to regularly review your **Inbox** and aim for it to be empty (as you would for emails)!

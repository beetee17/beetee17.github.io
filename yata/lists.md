# Lists

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a popular task management system created by David Allen. The methodology is based on a simple truth: **our brains are for having ideas, not storing them**.

The more information bouncing around inside your head, the harder it is to decide what needs attention. As a result, **you spend more time thinking about your tasks than actually doing them**. When information piles up in your head, it can lead to stress, anxiety, or a loss in focus.

The GTD method describes **how to dump all your mental clutter into an external system and then organize it so you can focus on the right things at the right times**.

When your GTD workflow is set up right, you’ll be able to confidently answer “*what should I be working on?*” at any given moment without worrying that you might forget something important you need to do later.

Yata makes it easy to incorporate a similar workflow. The four main GTD lists of **Inbox**, **Today**, **Anytime** and **Someday** are baked right into the app.


The **Inbox is the default starting point for all tasks**. It is recommended to regularly review your **Inbox** and aim for it to be empty (as you would for emails) by moving tasks to a more appropriate list. 

**Anytime** tasks can be thought of as **“bonus” tasks for the day**. When **Today**’s tasks have been competed ahead of schedule, look into the **Anytime** list for more items to get done. 

Another recommended workflow is to review the **Anytime** list at the end of the day and move selected tasks to be (tomorrow’s) Today tasks.

**Tasks that you want to work on in the future but not right now can be stored in Someday**. For example, books to read, blog post ideas, etc. You can then review these tasks when time and energy permit.


Yata makes it easy to perform review sessions and move tasks from one list to another in bulk via the edit mode.

# Lists

Inspired by the Getting Things Done (GTD) philosophy introduced by David Allen, Yata comes with 4 default lists that you can optionally use to incorporate into your productivity workflow.  

The 4 lists are: Inbox, Today, Anytime and Someday.  
                    
Similar to areas, each task can only be in a single list. We may think of these lists as statuses for our tasks. For example, a task may start in the Inbox, be moved into Anytime, then moved into Today, where it is finally completed.

In Yata, it is easy to perform review sessions and move tasks from one list to another in bulk via the edit mode.

### Overall Structure

GTD is a popular task management system created by David Allen. The methodology is based on a simple truth: **our brains are for having ideas, not storing them**.

The more information bouncing around inside your head, the harder it is to decide what needs attention. As a result, **you spend more time thinking about your tasks than actually doing them**. When information piles up in your head, it can lead to stress, anxiety, or a loss in focus.

The GTD method describes **how to dump all your mental clutter into an external system and then organize it so you can focus on the right things at the right times**.

When your GTD workflow is set up right, you’ll be able to confidently answer “*what should I be working on?*” at any given moment without worrying that you might forget something important you need to do later.

Yata makes it easy to incorporate a similar workflow, with the **Inbox**, **Scheduled**, **Anytime** and **Someday** lists.

In Yata, a task is shown in the **Inbox** when it does not have an assigned [intent date](https://beetee17.github.io/yata/intent). It is recommended to regularly review your **Inbox** and aim for it to be empty (as you would for emails)!

### Intent

In Yata, there is a clear separation between a task's **intent date** (i.e. when you want to work on it), and its **due date** (i.e. deadline).

This is because in reality, we tend not to only start working on our tasks at or right before its due date (or at least we try not to). Therefore, having this separation helps you to capture this important distinction, unlike most conventional Todo applications.

The **Inbox** displays tasks that do not have an assigned intent date.

It is recommended to regularly review your **Inbox** and aim for it to be empty (as you would for emails)!

#### Special Intents

There are **two special kinds** of intent 'dates' that are separate from real dates, **Anytime** and **Someday**.

These are useful for scheduling tasks in a meaningful way when you do not yet know exactly when you want to do them, **instead of arbitrarily assigning a date in order to rid them from the Inbox**.

### Subtasks

**Most tasks are not well-represented as a single step**, with a binary state of completed and incomplete. Oftentimes, we are faced with tasks that are broad or complex, and become demotivated as we do not know where to start.

Subtasks allow you to overcome this issue and **group closely related tasks together**. They allow you to **break down a task into smaller components**.

### Tags

**Tags** function as **'soft' links between tasks**. A task can have **multiple** tags.

**Tags** are useful to** group task into broad categories**, and as an alternative to **Areas** when a **task fits into more than one category**.

### Projects

**Projects** are **completable collections of tasks**.

**Projects** are useful to **group related tasks that share the same end goal**. Doing so allows you to stay organised and focus on related tasks easily.

### Areas

**Areas** are **collections of projects and tasks**.

**Areas** are useful to **group related projects and tasks into specific categories**. Doing so allows you to stay organised and focus on related tasks easily.

### Timeblocking

Timeblocking is a convenience feature that **helps you fight procrastination and stay motivated!**.

A timeblock is a **special type of subtask that can have many parent tasks**.

**Timeblocks are treated like normal tasks** in Yata (i.e. it has all the abilities of a normal task eg rescheduling, priority, tags etc), but is also **softly linked to its parent task(s)** to provide additional context. 

#### Why Use Time Blocks?

##### Usecase 1 - Breaking up complex tasks progressively

Sometime we have tasks that **aren’t easily broken down into smaller chunks**. And usually, they **take multiple sittings** to get done. Such tasks are not only **intimidating to tackle**, but they also **do not make us feel rewarded** for incremental progress made on them. 

Both of these factors **increase the likelihood of procrastinatio**.

Take a task such as **“Write the first draft of the essay”** for example. If you had scheduled the task to be worked on for an hour, but did not complete it during that sitting, there is no reward for that. In fact, you are **“punished” by having an incomplete task left in the schedule**.

With time blocks, you can schedule such large tasks into "blocks". A timeblock simply means **“I want to make progress on this task, but I do not yet know what specifically I will have accomplished at the end of the sitting”**. 

In this way, you can now mark the timeblock as complete after spending the time on the task, **regardless** of if you have actually finished **“Writing the first draft”**.

##### Usecase 2 - Scheduling multiple small tasks as a group

#### Tips
After completing a **timeblock**, you can then rename it to **specify what exactly was achieved during that sitting**, for general bookkeeping and also **to help you plan next actions**.

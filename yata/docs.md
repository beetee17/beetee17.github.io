## Intent

In Yata, there is a clear separation between a task's **intent date** (i.e. when you want to work on it), and its **due date** (i.e. deadline).

This is because in reality, we tend not to only start working on our tasks at or right before its due date (or at least we try not to). Therefore, having this separation helps you to capture this important distinction.

The **Inbox** displays tasks that do not have an assigned intent date.

It is recommended to regularly review your **Inbox** and aim for it to be empty (as you would for emails)!

#### Special Intents

There are **two special kinds** of intent 'dates' that are separate from real dates, **Anytime** and **Someday**.

These are useful for scheduling tasks in a meaningful way when you do not yet know exactly when you want to do them, **instead of arbitrarily assigning a date in order to rid them from the Inbox**.

## Subtasks

**Many tasks are not well-represented as a single step**, with a binary state of completed and incomplete. Oftentimes, we are faced with tasks that are **broad or complex**, and become demotivated as we do not know where to start.

Subtasks allow you to overcome this issue and **group closely related tasks together**. They allow you to **break down a task into smaller components**.

## Tags

**Tags** function as **'soft' links between tasks**. A task can have **multiple** tags.

**Tags** are useful to **group task into broad categories**, and as an alternative to **Areas** when a **task fits into more than one category**.

## Projects

**Projects** are **completable collections of tasks**.

**Projects** are useful to **group related tasks that share the same end goal**. Doing so allows you to stay organised and focus on related tasks easily.

## Areas

**Areas** are **collections of projects and tasks**.

**Areas** are useful to **group related projects and tasks into specific categories**. Doing so allows you to stay organised and focus on related tasks easily.

## Time Blocking

> If you don't control your schedule, it will control you.

Time blocking (and its close cousin, task batching) is **a simple, yet effective way to take back control of your workday**.

It a time management method that asks you to **divide your day into blocks of time**. Each block is **dedicated to accomplishing a specific task, or group of tasks**. 

Instead of keeping an open-ended to-do list of things you’ll get to as you’re able, you’ll start each day with a concrete schedule that lays out what you’ll work on and when.

**Yata makes it easy to implement such a workflow** with various convenience features.

In Yata, a time block is a **special type of subtask that can have many parent tasks**.

**Time blocks are treated like normal tasks** (i.e. it has all the abilities of a normal task eg rescheduling, priority, tags etc), but they are also **softly linked to its parent task(s)** to provide additional context. 


### Why Use Time Blocks?

#### Use Case 1: Breaking up complex tasks progressively

Sometime we have tasks that **aren’t easily broken down into smaller chunks**. And usually, they **take multiple sittings** to get done. Such tasks are not only **intimidating to tackle**, but they also **do not make us feel rewarded** for incremental progress made on them. 

Both of these factors **increase the likelihood of procrastinatio**.

Take a task such as **“Write the first draft of the essay”** for example. If you had scheduled the task to be worked on for an hour, but did not complete it during that sitting, there is no reward for that. In fact, you are **“punished” by having an incomplete task left in the schedule**.

Time blocks allow you to schedule such large tasks in terms **smaller, more manageable and actionable chunks**. This is because you can think of a time block as a task that is considered complete once the alloted time has been spent on its parent task(s). 

This means that **regardless** of if you have actually finished **“Writing the first draft”**, you can complete its time block and feel good about yourself, as you should!

In this way, time blocks can **relieve the stress and anxiety** that comes from focusing too much on a task's **outcomes**, by shifting that focus onto **effort** instead.

##### Tip

After completing a **time block**, you can rename it to **specify what exactly was achieved during that sitting**, for general bookkeeping and also **to help you plan next actions**. 


#### Use Case 2: Task Batching

Task batching is when you **group similar (usually smaller) tasks together and schedule a specific time block to complete them all at once**. 

By tackling similar tasks in a group, you’ll **limit the amount of context switching you have to do throughout your day**, saving precious time and mental energy. 

For example, scheduling two 20-minute blocks to process email during the day is more efficient than checking your inbox every 15 minutes.

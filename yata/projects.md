# Projects

Projects are completable collections of tasks and subtasks.

Projects are useful to group related tasks that share the same end goal. Doing so allows you to take advantage of the app's filtering system and focus on related tasks easily.

Create or edit projects from the filters menu. Quickly organise your projects into areas with a drag and drop gesture

# Projects

Projects are completable collections of tasks.

Projects are useful to group related tasks that share the same end goal. Doing so allows you to stay organised and focus on related tasks easily.

To create a project, tap on the plus icon in the main menu, located beside the *Projects* section header.

You may also group related projects into areas for an extra layer of organisation. To assign a project to an area, swipe left and tap on the *folder* icon.

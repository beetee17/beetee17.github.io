# Tags

Tags function as 'soft' links between tasks. A task can have multiple tags.

Tags are useful to group task into broad categories, and as an alternative to Areas when a task fits into more than one category.  

Update a task's tags by swiping right on a task, and tapping on the *Tag* button. You can also manage your tags from the menu that is presented.

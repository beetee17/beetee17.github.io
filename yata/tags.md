# Tags

Tags function as 'soft' links between tasks. Tasks have a 'many-to-many' relationship with tags, i.e. each task can have multiple tags, and vice versa. This is unique from Lists and Areas.  


Tags are useful to group task into broad categories, and as an alternative to Areas when a task fits into more than one category.  

Create or edit tags from the filters menu. You can also assign a unique colour to your tags for easier visual identification!

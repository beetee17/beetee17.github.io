# Areas

Areas have a 'one-to-many' relationship with tasks, i.e. each task can only be in a single area at any time. This is similar to Lists but unique from Tags.

Areas are useful to group projects or tasks into specific categories. Doing so allows you to take advantage of the app's filtering system and focus on related tasks easily.

Create or edit areas from the filters menu. You can even assign a unique coloured icon to each area from eaasier visual identification.

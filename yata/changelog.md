## What's New in Yata 2.1

Yata 2.1 builds upon the foundation set in 2.0, enhancing performance, maintainability, scalability, and overall stability. Alongside numerous small refinements and extra polish, here are the key highlights of this release:

### Themes: Reimagined

Discover the all-new Theme Gallery located in **Settings → Themes**! Yata 2.1 takes theming to a new level, offering an intuitive and delightful experience for exploring, customising, and managing various aesthetics. Make Yata uniquely yours and transform it into your bespoke productivity hub.

If you'd like to share your personal creations, email them to yata.feedback@gmail.com with the subject of **App Theme Showcase**, and they _might_ just appear as one of the defaults in future updates!

### More Widgets, More Power

Yata 2.1 introduces expanded widget capabilities. The Task widget can now display tasks from **any** list, e.g. Upcoming, Anytime, Someday, or even specific areas or projects. On iOS 17 only, the widgets are now also interactive, allowing you to mark tasks as complete right from your home screen.

The Schedule widget now not only showcases your tasks but also seamlessly integrates your calendar events, enabling quick access with a single tap!

_Note:_ Existing users may need to reset their widgets due to the significant changes in this update.

**Undo:** Keep an eye out for a discreet banner that appears after performing critical actions. This handy feature lets you easily undo actions like task completion or deletion.

**Preview**: Tasks with attachments now provide a convenient preview of these attachments in the bottom sheet for quick and easy access.

## What's New in Yata 2.0

Yata has been completely rewritten from the ground up to make it more performant, maintainable, scalable, and stable. Besides the many small tweaks and under-the-hood improvements, here are a couple of major changes in this update!

### New Icon

Yata 2.0 comes with a brand new icon that reflcts its light-hearted style! As this is quite a radical change, you are able to switch back to the original icon in Settings → App Icon.

### Themes

Personalise the app's appearance to reflect your own unique style! Many of the app's colours such as the Primary, Secondary, Accent and Text colours are now customisable via Settings → Themes. This update also ships with 11 beautiful light/dark themes for you to choose from or get inspired by.

Enjoy!

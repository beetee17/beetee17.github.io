## Intent Dates

In Yata, there is a clear separation between a task's intent date (i.e. when you want to work on it), and its due date (i.e. deadline).

This is because in reality, we tend not to only start working on our tasks at or right before its due date (or at least we try not to). Therefore, having this separation helps you to capture this important distinction, unlike most conventional Todo applications.

Moreover, there are two special kinds of intent 'dates' that are separate from real dates. These are the **Anytime** and **Someday** intents. **Anytime** and **Someday** are useful for scheduling tasks in a meaningful way when you do not yet know exactly when you want to do them, instead of arbitrarily assigning a date in order to rid them from the **Inbox**.

**Anytime** and **Someday** tasks will appear in the **Anytime** and **Someday** lists respectively. Moreover, as implied above, the **Inbox** will not show tasks that are marked for **Anytime** or **Someday**.

**Anytime** tasks can be thought of as **“bonus” tasks for the day**. When today’s tasks have been completed ahead of schedule, look into the **Anytime** list for more items to get done. 

Another recommended workflow is to review the **Anytime** list at the end of the day and move selected tasks to be tomorrow’s tasks.

**Tasks that you want to work on in the future but not right now can be stored in Someday**. For example, books to read, blog post ideas, etc. You can then review these tasks when time and energy permit.

Lastly, the **Scheduled** list shows a sorted list of tasks that have a *real* intent date (i.e. not **Anytime** or **Someday**).

### Scheduling Tasks
Assigning an intent date to a task is extremely intuitive! 

When creating a task, simply use natural language to specify the intent date. For example, "Do work on sunday" or "Do work next wednesday at 3pm".

Natural language can also be used to reschedule a task:
- To activate the rescheduler in the Tasks tab, swipe right on a task and tap on the *Calendar* button.
- To activate the rescheduler in the Upcoming tab, tap on the task's time, or long press on the task if it does not have a time.

### Notes
In the future, Yata aims to add on to this intent feature with the following improvements:
- Notifications for intent dates (reminders to start working on a task)
- Allow the option to automatically schedule due tasks for Today.

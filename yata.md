### Main Features
- **iCloud Integration**. All your tasks and data are automatically kept in sync between iOS devices that share an iCloud account. 

- **Daily Planner**. Yata deeply integrates with your device's calendar, allowing you to schedule pomodoro-style time blocks for your tasks in seconds.

- **Flexible Organisation System**. Categorise and group tasks in a way that makes most sense to you with as many (or as little) of the provided methods, such as **subtasking**, **tags**, **projects**, **areas**. 

- **Quick Add** allows you to create tasks with minimal friction. The appropriate attributes of the new task are automatically inferred based on your current location within the app. There is also support for **natural language dates**, allowing you to schedule tasks inline. 

- **Private**. Yata has no access to any of your tasks and data, as they are stored securely in iCloud.

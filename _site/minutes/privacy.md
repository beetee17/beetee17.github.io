# Privacy Policy for Minutes: AI Voice Notes

Minutes and its developer take your privacy very seriously. Minutes does not sell or rent your data, and anonymous information is only collected to help make the app better. If you want a privacy-first app for OpenAI, Minutes is a very safe bet.

Minutes uses the OpenAI API to transcribe your audio and generate transcript summaries, therefore OpenAI is able to see requests made and use that information (such as, as with all Internet requests, your IP address, and if you sign in to OpenAI within Minutes, your account ID, for instance) as they see fit (for advertising or something of the like, as an example). By using Minutes, you're subject to OpenAI's [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).

Minutes can also be prompted to request specific permission(s) from your Notion account, such as for the ability to export transcript summaries to your Notion database. Notion (rightly) requests that you give the client the ability to do these things. Minutes never performs any actions without you clearly requesting it to (such as by tapping a button). Such use cases are covered by Notion's [Privacy Policy](https://www.notion.so/Privacy-Policy-3468d120cf614d4c9014c09f6adc9091) and [Terms and Conditions](https://www.notion.so/Terms-Conditions-98f96f84a66d4454a573b62ac4240780).

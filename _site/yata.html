<p>About 1.5 years ago, I was looking for a task manager to help organise my school and personal life. For better or worse, I decided to make one myself, because why spend a couple of bucks for an app when you can spend &gt;1000 hours coding your own instead, right? Right…</p>

<p>In all seriousness, Yata is a to-do app that combines both task management and daily planning into a powerful productivity tool for you to get things done. As the name suggests, Yata is well aware of the fierce competition in the task management space, but it aims to be the best task manager for likeminded users.</p>

<p>Do test out the new Time Blocks feature and feedback on its usefulness!</p>

<p>Time Blocks allows you to easily split up a complex task into easy, rewarding and actionable subtasks. You can find/test this feature by scheduling a task as per normal.</p>

<p>Why Use Time Blocks?</p>

<p>Sometime we have tasks that aren’t easily broken down into smaller chunks. And usually, these tasks take multiple sittings to get done. These tasks are not only intimidating to tackle, they also do not make us feel rewarded when we make incremental progress on them. Both of these factors increase the likelihood of procrastination.</p>

<p>Take a task such as “Write the first draft of the essay” for example. Right now, if you schedule the task to be worked on for x hours, but did not complete it during that sitting, there is no reward for that. In fact, you are “punished” by having an incomplete task left in the schedule.</p>

<p>With time blocks, you can schedule that big task as a “block”. A block simply means “I want to make progress on this task, but I do not yet know what specifically I will have accomplished at the end of the sitting”.</p>

<p>This block is a task by itself (it has all the abilities of a normal task eg rescheduling, priority, tags etc), but is also softly linked to the parent task so that you are able view all the blocks of each task.</p>

<p>However, you can now mark the block as complete after spending the time on the task, regardless of if you have actually finished “Writing the first draft”.</p>

<p>You can then also rename the block post-completion to specify what exactly was achieved during that sitting, for general bookkeeping and also to help you plan next actions.</p>

<p>In this way, you are rewarded for any incremental progress made towards a task.</p>

<h3 id="changed-4">Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Due and overdue tasks that are incomplete are now brought forward to your Schedule</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-6">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix rescheduler not detecting end times</li>
  <li>Various improvements to the UI and animations of the mini detail view</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="080-7---2022-11-14">[0.8.0 (7)] - 2022-11-14</h2>
<h3 id="added-13">Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Further improvements to the Share Extension’s UI and logic</li>
  <li>You are now able to create recurring tasks that only caluculate the next date upon completion(rather than on a fixed schedule).</li>
  <li>This is useful to model certain types of tasks with a less stringent recurrence.</li>
  <li>For example, if you would like to create a task “Go to the dentist” every 6 months. Since this type of task is more flexible, you may only complete the task 3 months after its due date. However, you do not want the next “Go to the dentist” task to be created based on its original date (that would mean the next appointment was due just 3 months from now). Rather, you may prefer that it added 6 months to the current date instead.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="080-6---2022-11-11">[0.8.0 (6)] - 2022-11-11</h2>
<h3 id="added-14">Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Revamped the share extension on iOS! Quickly transform any url, file, screenshot, or plain text into a task too be sent to your inbox or any area of your choice.</li>
  <li>For example, this might be useful for collecting “read-later” items. On any browser, tap the share button and choose “Yata”, and the link will automatically be added to the task’s notes, ready for you to give a title and send it on its way to your Inbox.</li>
  <li>You can now edit your tags in the Tag Selector view.</li>
  <li>More default colours to choose from!</li>
  <li>You can now customise due alert timing within quick add view</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changed-5">Changed</h3>

<p>Apologies for the duplication of data after the recent updates! Unfortunately, upon investigation it seems to be a bug on Apple’s side… It occurs due to certain changes in the database that cannot be handled correctly by iCloud (so it duplicates all data as a safeguard). However, as the current state of the app’s architecture is relatively mature already, hopefully such changes will not be required in the future!</p>

# Yata: Yet Another To-Do App

Yata is a to-do app that combines both task management and daily planning into a powerful productivity tool for you to get things done.

As the name suggests, Yata is well aware of the fierce competition in the task management space. Yata is entirely written by a single person, and aims to be the best todo app for likeminded users.
